            <h1>About Us</h1>
              <p> This user-friendly application for getting nutritional information about foods was developed by Team One. 
                 It was created to meet requirements for Project2 in the Vanderbilt Trilogy coding bootcamp, February 2020.

              </p>
          

           <h3> Why did we build this application and what purpose does it solve </h3>
            <p> We built this application to provide a practical tool to access information about food and drinks.   
              It is designed so that the user can get calorie or nutiritional info directly, and make their own decisions.  
              The program can be used for diet planning, menu selection or just as a helpful source for
              people trying to maintain healthy lifestyles.\
              It also directs users to other resources for more in-depth information. </p>
