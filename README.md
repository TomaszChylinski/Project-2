        We built this application to provide a practical tool to access information about food and drinks.
        It is designed so that the user can get calorie or nutiritional info directly, and make their own decisions.
        The program can be used for diet planning, menu selection or just as a helpful source for
        people trying to maintain healthy lifestyles.
